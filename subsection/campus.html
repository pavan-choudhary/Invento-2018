						So, what is a Campus Ambassador?

						Campus Ambassadors are representatives of all the colleges participating in Invento. They play a pivotal role in providing maximum coverage for the fest, by spreading the word amongst their peers through various social media and providing a medium for communication between their institution and IET-DAVV. With time, each Campus Ambassador becomes an integral part of the Invento family, and are regularly in touch with the team operating in IET_DAVV. Each CA is tasked with providing maximum publicity, both offline and online, of Effe in their respective institution and encourage active participation from students of all years.
